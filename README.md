# MessageBoard Challenge
## Developed By: Christian von Lehe


## Description
The purpose of this application was really just to demonstrate my abilities as a React developer. I fully understand that the use of the backend (AKA json-server) is not how you would do things in a production level application, especially the authentication, but given the task assignment that's okay.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the message-board-challenge folder
3. install the dependencies `yarn install`

To run the application `yarn start`
To build the application `yarn build`

##Technology used:
- React
- Redux
- Webpack/Babel
- json-server
- axios
- uuid
- moment
- concurrently
